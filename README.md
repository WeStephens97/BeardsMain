# BeardsMain
The main repository for the group "Beards"

Before playing the game make sure you have the proper paths for the SDK and fxml modules in workspace.
After that you must download all files (except the README file and the ConvertFileToDatabase files.) 
You must also compile all the .java files.

To play the game you must click in the text field.
Then type any of the following words "straight" right" left "back".
The options for each screen will appear in the text area.
The text box is sensitive to capitalization so type the word as presented in the dialogue.
You will either reach a "Win" screen or a "Lose" screen upo finishing the game.
There are some crashes which we could not resolve with the most infamous being typing "straight" while at the cave will crash the game for no explainable reason.
